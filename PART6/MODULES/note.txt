Whst is Encapsultion ? 
Ans:- Encapsulation is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.



------------------Key Concepts:-----------------------------
-------------Data Hiding:-------------------
Internal object details (like variables) are hidden from the outside world.

Only the necessary parts are exposed through public methods (getters/setters or interfaces).

-----------------Access Modifiers:----------------
Encapsulation is enforced using access specifiers like:

a. private (only accessible within the class)

b. protected (accessible within the class and subclasses)

c. public (accessible from outside the class)


------------------Controlled Access:--------------------------

Instead of allowing direct access to fields, you use getters and setters to control how values are read or updated.
