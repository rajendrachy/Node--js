------------------- Difference Between Route and Endpoint in Express.js----------------
-------------- Route:---------------
A route is the URL pattern or path you define in your server (e.g., /users or /products/:id).

Routes help organize how different paths are handled in your application.

......Examples of routes:......
/users
/products/:id






--------------------- Endpoint:----------------------------
An endpoint is a combination of a route + HTTP method (e.g., GET /users, POST /products).

Endpoints define the specific action that should happen for a given request type.

....Examples of endpoints......
GET /users
POST /users
DELETE /products/:id
