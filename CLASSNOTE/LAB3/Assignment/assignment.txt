A.	Periodic Logger with File System Module
Build a simple Node.js script that runs continuously and logs the current timestamp to a file named activity.log every 10 Seconds.
Requirements
1.	Use the fs module to write to a file.
2.	The file name should be: activity.log
3.	Every 2 minutes:
o	Get the current system time.
o	Format it in readable form (e.g., 2025-06-30 14:02:00).
o	Append this timestamp to the file activity.log with a message like:
Log entry at 2025-06-30 14:02:00
4.	Ensure:
o	If the file doesn't exist, it should be created.
o	If it exists, it should append to the file (not overwrite).









B.	Copy a File Using Node.js File System Module
Write a Node.js script that copies a file named report.pdf from the root directory to a folder named backups located in the same directory as your script.
1.	Source File: The file to copy is report.pdf and is located in the root directory where the script runs.
2.	Destination Folder: ./backups/
3.	If the backups folder does not exist, the script should create it.
4.	After copying, print a message like:
File copied successfully to backups/report.pdf
5.	If an error occurs (like the source file is missing), it should display a clear error message.

 








C.	List All Files in a Directory
Read the contents of the documents/ folder and print the names of all files inside.
Write a Node.js script that reads all the files inside a folder named documents/ and prints their names to the console.

Requirements
1.	The folder name is documents/.
2.	The folder is located in the same directory as your script.
3.	The script should:
o	Check if the folder exists.
o	List all items inside (files and subfolders).
o	Filter and print only file names, not directories.











D.	Backup System for .txt Files
Create a Node.js script that:
•	Scans the folder myNotes/
•	Finds all .txt files
•	Copies them into a new folder backupNotes/
•	Skips non-.txt files
•	Creates the destination folder if it doesn't exist
Requirements
1.	Source folder: myNotes/
o	Located in the same directory as your script
o	Contains various file types (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .jpg)
2.	Destination folder: backupNotes/
o	Created automatically if it doesn’t exist
3.	Copy only files that end with .txt
4.	Print a success message for each file copied
